========================================

Release Notes:
--------------
To run the game from the Binary, simply open "Bin\SupermanIVR.exe".
To edit the project, run Unity3D (Free or Pro) and load the project, which is the "SupermanProject" folder. Afterwards click on the "Play" button to start the game.
(If you see a blank screen, click on the "SupermanScene" script from the "Project" tab.)
!! The game can also be run without VR glasses !!

* Remember to calibrate the glasses before starting, Set zero towards the Kinect
* Set the resolution of the executable to 1024x768 or higher for best results.
* Start the tracking procedure with OpenNI's calibration pose, usually this works better without wearing the VR glasses (they mirror)


Please note that the main code file is the script "SupermanProject\Assets\Superman\Nite.cs".
The wrapper for the Vuzix glasses is also in there. This makes use of the "SupermanProject\Release\iWearWrapper.dll" file. The source of this file is in the folder "SupermanProject\iWear".
The NITE wrapper for Unity was developed by OpenNI (https://github.com/OpenNI/UnityWrapper).
For more information: there is a pdf report in the "Bin" folder.
